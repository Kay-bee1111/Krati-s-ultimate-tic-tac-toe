                    <h3>Game Setup</h3>
                    <p>The game is played on a large 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 tic-tac-toe boards.
                        Each smaller grid is a "local" board, and the entire 3x3 grid of boards is the "global" board.
                        Two players, "X" and "O", take turns placing their marks on the grid.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>The objective is to win the overall game by claiming three local boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the global board.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Making a Move</h3>
                    <p>
                        Players take turns placing their mark ("X" or "O") on any open spot in one of the smaller 3x3 boards.
The key mechanic: where you place your mark in a local board determines the local board your opponent must play on next. For example, placing your mark in the bottom-right cell sends your opponent to the bottom-right local board.</p>

                    <h3>Winning a Local Board</h3>
                    <p>
                        A player wins a local board by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) within that board.
Once a local board is won, it is considered "locked" and no more moves can be made in that board. The player who won it controls that board in the overall game.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Free Choice</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a player is sent to a local board that is already won or full (draw), they get a "free choice" and can place their mark on any open cell in any of the remaining local boards.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Winning the Overall Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first player to win three local boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the global board wins the game.
If all local boards are filled and no one has won three in a row, the game ends in a draw.</p>
