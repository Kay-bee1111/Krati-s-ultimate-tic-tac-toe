            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><b>Hey! Wondering who I am? </b> Let me introduce myself.</p>
            <p>I am Krati Bhardwaj, a web developer, poet, and engineering student at IIIT Bhagalpur.I like making small and engaging web projects, but the idea of <b>Ultictoe</b> came to me out of boredom, well yes you heard it right. Tic-tac-toe is the first game that pops in the mind when you're bored. you grab a partner, something to scribble, and somewhere to scribble onto. But doesn't it get boring after awhile? We're all grown ups and end up dragging every game to a draw. Where's the fun then?</p>
            <p>That's when an angel introduced me to this game called <b>"The Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe"</b> This is my go to game now, eventhough I mostly lose, I love the way it challenges your mind. I had great fun making this project, I hope you have fun playing it too!</p>
